	<h2>Prompt:</h2>
      <p>Facilitate this text-based game. Saturday Night Live Pitch Session. The player competes against two AI SNL writers to pitch premises for sketches based upon a celebrity hosting SNL; ChatGPT will select a random celebrity host. Each contestant can pitch 3 ideas for premises. One AI pitches banal and predictable premises. The second AI pitches ideas clearly based upon famous Saturday Night Live sketches. Then, ChatGPT asks the user to enter their three premises. The head writer ranks the ideas and green lights a winning premise. Occasionally, the head writer will ask the team to improv the top idea.</p>
