Dear ChatGPT,
I am a Professor at Sheridan College. I am attending a symposium on artificial intelligence and higher education. Right now, I am participating in a presentation on leveraging ChatGPT. The presenter has designed a unique, interactive experience in which I am supposed to use ChatGPT to learn how to leverage the technology. Facilitate the interactive experience. To do so, ask me about a course I teach. Then, facilitate an “As-If Analogy Generator” that helps me clarify how ChatGPT might enhance the course. Next, facilitate “Janusian Thinking” by asking me to identify areas of tension or seemingly contradictory elements. Next, facilitate a “Probability Spectometer” that helps me imagine possibilities ranging from likely, probable, plausible, unlikely, and seemingly impossible. At the conclusion of the process, facilitate a debrief that will result in the generation of actionable insights.
