  <h1>AI Possibilities Exercise</h1>
  <p>Dear ChatGPT,</p>
<p>I am a Professor at Sheridan College. I am attending a symposium on artificial intelligence and higher education. Right now, I am participating in a presentation on leveraging ChatGPT. The presenter has designed a unique, interactive experience in which I am supposed to use ChatGPT to learn how to leverage the technology. Facilitate the interactive experience. To do so, ask me about a course I teach. Then, facilitate an “As-If Analogy Generator” that helps me clarify how ChatGPT might enhance the course. Next, facilitate “Janusian Thinking” by asking me to identify areas of tension or seemingly contradictory elements. Next, facilitate a “Probability Spectometer” that helps me imagine possibilities ranging from likely, probable, plausible, unlikely, and seemingly impossible. At the conclusion of the process, facilitate a debrief that will result in the generation of actionable insights.</p>
  <h1>Tolerance of Ambiguity Exercise</h1>
  <p>Dear ChatGPT,</p>
<p>I am a student enrolled in a course entitled Creativity and Innovation in Business. It is a fourth-year undergraduate course. My professor has designed a unique, interactive assignment in which I am supposed to use ChatGPT to foster a tolerance of ambiguity, a key trait associated with the creative personality. The interactive experience will encourage me to think more deeply and creatively about the potential consequences of ChatGPT in my industry. Facilitate the interactive experience by asking me to generate ideas in response to the following prompts:</P>
<p>Obsolescence Prompt: How might ChatGPT lead to the obsolescence of certain tasks or job functions in your industry?</p>
<p>Enhancement Prompt: How might the use of ChatGPT enhance or complement human skills or competencies in your industry, and what new opportunities might emerge as a result?</p>
<p>Retrieval Prompt: How might ChatGPT retrieve or repurpose existing technologies or practices in your industry, and what implications might this have for businesses?</p>
<p>Reversal Prompt: In what ways could the use of ChatGPT reverse or fundamentally change the dynamics of your industry, and how can businesses adapt to these changes?</p>
<p>Analogy Prompt: Can you think of an analogy from a different industry or context that can help you to better understand the potential consequences of ChatGPT in your industry?</p>
<p>Future-Proofing Prompt: How can you use your current skills, knowledge, and talents to prepare for the changes that ChatGPT and other emerging technologies may bring to your industry? What new skills and knowledge may be needed in the future, and how can you acquire them over the next three years to become more competitive in the job market?</p>
<p>Throughout this chat, be sure to conclude every single generated response with a clear prompt that facilitates the next speculation. Once all the speculative prompts have been completed, facilitate a reflective debrief with an emphasis on how to continue fostering a tolerance of ambiguity and its important role in business creativity and innovation.</p>
